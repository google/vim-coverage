This file demonstrates the coverage.py integration for python.

In order for these tests to work, maktaba MUST be in the same parent directory
as coverage. Given that that's the case, all we have to do is source the
setupvroom.vim file, which bootstraps the coverage plugin and configures it to
work properly under vroom.

  :let g:repo = fnamemodify($VROOMFILE, ':p:h:h:h')
  :source $VROOMDIR/setupvroom.vim

NOTE: These tests also require python's coverage module to be installed (the
python-coverage package on Debian-based systems). If it's not installed, vroom
will fail to run this file, failing with an error like
"Couldn't import python coverage module".

Coverage.py coverage reports are stored in .coverage files, typically generated
in the project root directory by running something like
"nosetests --with-coverage". With that in place, the :CoverageShow command will
surface the coverage results inside your vim editor.

  :let g:tmpdir = tempname()
  :call mkdir(g:tmpdir)
  :execute 'cd' g:tmpdir
  :silent edit blah.py
  :setf python
  % import sys<CR>
  |if False:<CR>
  |  print("If you can read this...")<CR>
  |  print("...your False is broken")<CR>
  |sys.exit(0)<CR>
  |print("Are you still here?!")
  :silent write

  :call WriteFakeCoveragePyFile(g:tmpdir, {'blah.py': [1, 2, 5]})

  :CoverageShow coverage.py
  ~ Coverage is 50% (3/6 lines (1 partial)).
